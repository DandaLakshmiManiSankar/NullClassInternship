My Internship Tasks on GenAI Chatbot Creation (Duration: Feb10-Mar10,2025)
--------------------


1. Add basic analytics to track user interactions, such as number of queries, most common topics, and user satisfaction ratings. Expected Outcome: A dashboard displaying key metrics about chatbot usage.

2. Develop a multi-modal chatbot Explanation: Extend the chatbot to handle and generate both text and image content using Google Palm and Gemini AI capabilities. Expected Outcome: A chatbot that can understand image inputs, generate relevant images, and seamlessly integrate visual and textual information in conversations.

3. Extend the existing chatbot to support at least three additional languages beyond its original language. The chatbot should be able to detect the user's language automatically, switch between languages seamlessly, and provide culturally appropriate responses. Additionally, implement advanced language processing features to enhance the chatbot's understanding and generation capabilities across all supported languages.
